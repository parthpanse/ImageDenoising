# Image Denoising Using CNN.
This repository contains the code and presentation for the project “Image Denoising Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)”. The project aims to enhance the quality of images by removing noise using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction

Image Denoising Using CNN
n the realm of digital image processing, the challenge of noise reduction and enhancement of image
quality stands as a fundamental problem, especially in applications demanding high precision, such as
medical imaging and autonomous vehicle navigation. Our project endeavors to address this challenge
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We aim to explore and implement state-of-the-art
techniques in image denoising, leveraging the prowess of CNNs, recognized for their exceptional
performance in various computer vision tasks.

## Goals

The overarching goal of this project is to create a model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) that significantly enhances image quality by transforming noisy images into clearer, more
discernible ones. This objective is rooted in the fundamental challenge of noise in images, which can
severely distort important details, thereby reducing their utility for various applications. By focusing
on this aspect of image processing, the project aims to pioneer advancements in automated denoising
techniques using deep learning approaches. These advancements have the potential to dramatically
simplify and improve the denoising process, particularly benefiting fields such as medical imaging
and autonomous vehicle technology, where image clarity is paramount.

## Approach

In our project, various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and hyperparameters
are explored to optimize model performance. Two prominent models we found after thorough
investigation are ResNet, UNet[3]. ResNet, known for its deep residual learning, and UNet, for
semantic segmentation tasks, serve as diverse starting points for architectural exploration.

## Conclusion

The Image De-noising model implemented above is successful at removing noise and generating
clearer images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), when implemented properly for this task,
help address the fundamental problem of removing noise from images and return good results. As
seen above, the larger the number of iterations of the model, the better the output i.e. the clearer the
image. For future work, the project can be improved using a better, more powerful hardware (such as
a larger GPU), and larger input images. These steps can improve the output generated by the project.
These advancements have the potential to increase the noise reduction, work on different types and
sizes of images, and enhance the image.
